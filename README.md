# revisions-browser
Front-end revision browser via REST API proof of concept.

Requires: [REST API Version 2.0 develop branch](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/tree/develop)

What this does: adds revisions browsing link to top of admin bar when looking at single post and you can edit, with next/previous links.

* This UI is not stellar. Pull request welcome.
